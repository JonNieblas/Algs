# Algs
## About
A site containing calculators for solving different algorithms.
Algs is a small project I'm going to be working on to further understand
how different algorithms function.
I'm also going to be adding Docker, Jenkins, and Travis CI functionality
so that I may learn the ins and outs of these tools.

## Running Algs
To build this project, you will need Node.js, Python 3, and Docker.

# Algorithms
### Karatsuba's Algorithm (1962)
Karatsuba's algorithm is a classic multiplication algorithm that recursively
splits apart two large factors, achieving a quicker overall multiplication 
using less-costly operations.

### Schönhage–Strassen's Algorithm (1971)
Schönhage–Strassen's algorithms was an improvement upon Karatsuba's. 
Schönhage–Strassen's was the king of multiplication algorithms asymptotically,
with a run-time bit complexity of O(n * log(n) * log(log(n))) (where n is
the number of digits in the largest number being multiplied).
