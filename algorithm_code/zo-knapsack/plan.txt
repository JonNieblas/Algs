write a form that takes:
target weight
item & weight
plus button that allows for more form input

then:
take each item & weight,
add them to a data structure
use this instead of a file

first:
look at old code, see how long it would take to convert it
maybe just convert items to a list, pass the list (or hashmap maybe) and put it into a file
otherwise, might be better to convert the code
